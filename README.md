To use, download the quizzes folder, then upload an images.txt and items.txt file to the the page using the "choose files" button (it doesn't really upload). Then, click submit.

There are hotkeys shown on the tooltips for the buttons.

Most of the quizzes are really bad and have a lot of broken images, and some have completely incorrect images. The editor can be used to fix some of the quizzes, but most are just really bad.
